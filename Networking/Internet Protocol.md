## What it is?

-> The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/). IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps [routers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/) to send packets to the right place. Every device or [domain](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/) that connects to the Internet is assigned an [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/), and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.

Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

## IPv4 vs. IPv6

The fourth version of IP (IPv4 for short) was introduced in 1983. However, just as there are only so many possible permutations for automobile license plate numbers and they have to be reformatted periodically, the supply of available IPv4 addresses has become depleted. IPv6 addresses have many more characters and thus more permutations; however, IPv6 is not yet completely adopted, and most domains and devices still have IPv4 addresses.
