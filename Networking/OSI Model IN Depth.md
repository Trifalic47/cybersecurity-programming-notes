***
## 7 - Application Layer
-> *Helps in providing user interface for the generation of data and helps in sending and recieving data on the high level*
For Example -> Mail Clients,Microsoft World,VsCode,Photoshop,WebBrowsers

***

## 6 - Presentation Layer
-> *It encrypts the data into the form that the layers below this can understand.While recieving data it decrypts data so that application layer could understand*

***

## 5 - Session Layer
-> *It helps in establishing the connection between nodes over an network.It also provides the functionality of syncronization and checkpoint services*

***

## 4 - Transport Layer
-> *It manages the transport of data over an network using the network protocols like TCP/UDP.It establishes the port number where the service would run to transfer data*

***
## 3 - Network Layer
-> *This divides  the data in the form of packets and assing each packet an destination ip address.*

***
## 2 - Data Link
-> *It divides the data in the form of frames and add the host mac-address.*

***
## 1 - Physical Layer
-> *It is the bottommost layer of the OSI model and coverts the frames in the form of bits and sends through electromagnetic signals*

## How data is sent and recieved while using OSI Model
