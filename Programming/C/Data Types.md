#### What are Data Types
-> *In the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language\) "C (programming language)"), **data types** constitute the semantics and characteristics of storage of data elements. They are expressed in the language syntax in form of declarations for [memory locations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") or [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_\(computer_science\) "Variable (computer science)"). Data types also determine the types of operations or methods of processing of data elements.*

### Main types

The C language provides the four basic arithmetic type specifiers `char`, `int`, `float` and `double` (as well as the Boolean type `bool`), and the modifiers `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, and `long`. The following table lists the permissible combinations in specifying a large set of storage size-specific declarations.

#### Constants

The value of variables which remain the same and the value can't be changed.
*Using const keyword*

```c
const int MAX = 100;
```

*Using define*

```c
#define MAX 100;
```
